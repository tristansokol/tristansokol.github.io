There are lots of opportunitys to improve the CFP process. 

Problems:
* multiple cfp vendors aggregators makes discovry very manual. 

* it is hard

* no CFP platform stores all the talk and bio information, using it to apply to multiple conferences with the same talk.

* no way to track applied to conferences, let alone talks that have been successful. 

* markdown preview?

* cfp template?

Requirements:

* easy

* Store markdown of talks (markdown authoring will enable previwe via authoring tooling)


Solutions:
* Scrape CFPs from multiple places and put them in a calendar - export calendar?
* spreadsheet template to help you manage talks?
* google sheet function to pull in new talks to add?
* Calendar of talks & a repo of markdown talk files store with jekyll style front matter?
