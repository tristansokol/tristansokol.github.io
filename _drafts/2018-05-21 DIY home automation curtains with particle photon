I have never been much of a morning person, but nothing wakes me up better than the sun in all its blearly eyed glory. the hard part is convincing someone to come into my room in the morning to open up my curtains. Luckily, a robot can do that for me.

This project took a few iterations, and is still a work in progress, but we are definitely at a good point in its developement. 

Initally I wanted something that could open my curtains. the basic premisd was to attach the curtains to a length of pipe and then use a motor to roll the curtains up at the appropriate time. 

parts:
 * motor
 * pvc
 * h bridge
 * power supply
 * mounting screws
 * blackout curtain 
 * bracket - I spent some time wandering the eisles of home depot trying to find something that was a right angle, i coukd drill through pretty easily, and large enough to fit the mounting screws on my motor. 
 * particle photon


###hardware 
in My previous attempts with this project, the crux was attaching the motor to the curtains, and the wall, so i tackled that first. after some very approximate measurement i drilled holes into my bracket to mostly fit the mounting screws for my motor. 

to connect the motor shaft to the curtain pole, we used a pvc endcap with a hole drilled in it and another mounting screw for the motor shaft.
