A while ago I germinated so baby plants. I watered them a bit too much, so they got moldy, but they survived, and that hardship bonded us into a tight interspecies family. That is until I had to go on a work trip and they were left unwatered at a crucial time in thier tiny, tiny lives. I vowed on that day to never have that problem again.
