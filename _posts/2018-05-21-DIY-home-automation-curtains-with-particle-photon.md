I have never been much of a morning person, but nothing wakes me up better than the sun in all its bleary-eyed glory. the hard part is convincing someone to come into my room in the morning to open up my curtains. Luckily, a robot can do that for me.

This project took a few iterations, and is still a work in progress, but we are definitely at a good point in its development to share what is going on.

Initially I wanted something that could open my curtains. the basic premise was to attach the curtains to a length of pipe and then use a motor to roll the curtains up at the appropriate time.

### Parts:
 * motor: torque was an issue in the past, so I used a motor with a worm gear drive attached. You should be able to find a similar one with [this ebay search](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=12v+worm+gear+motor&_sop=12).
 * pvc
 * h bridge
 * power supply
 * mounting screws
 * blackout curtain 
 * bracket - I spent some time wandering the eisles of home depot trying to find something that was a right angle, i coukd drill through pretty easily, and large enough to fit the mounting screws on my motor. 
 * particle photon

### hardware
in My previous attempts with this project, the crux was attaching the motor to the curtains, and the wall, so i tackled that first. after some very approximate measurement i drilled holes into my bracket to mostly fit the mounting screws for my motor. 

to connect the motor shaft to the curtain pole, we used a pvc endcap with a hole drilled in it and another mounting screw for the motor shaft.
