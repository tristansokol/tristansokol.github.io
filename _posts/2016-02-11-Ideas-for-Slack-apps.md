title: Ideas for Slack Apps
---

Right now is a great time to build out a Slack app. They just launched their app marketpace, an opensource starter kit [botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit), and even created a fund to help get new projects off the ground [source](http://slackhq.com/post/134878632730/launch-platform)

As such, I've been pretending to be hard at work while fantasizing about weird ideas for slack apps that I could build. 

* __Big Brother__
   Imagine a Slack bot that was omnipresent, constantly monitoring what you said and did throughout your workday. They would see when you are online and away, keep track if you ask too many questions (or post too many .gifs). You could use it to spit out visualizations of when you are usually online, or your boss could use it to find out that you skip out at 4:20 every day. The only fun part would be letting the bot interject comments like 'Big Brother saw that' randomly into the channel. 
   
* __Dark/Magic Portal__
    This is a working title for about a million closely related ideas all generally inspired by the [MIT - Stanford Wormhole](http://engineering.stanford.edu/news/wormhole%E2%80%9D-connects-stanford-and-mit "MIT - Stanford Wormhole"). At the core there would be a bot in a channel with you that would act as a 'portal' to other people in a different channel or organization. Maybe it spawn a safe for work [Chatroulette](https://www.chatroulette.com/) like experience for lonely slackers, or maybe you could ask the portal a question and give it an offering of a gif and see what you get back. A couple apps try to match experts or like minded people on slck, but something a little more light hearted would ensure nobody uses this app for sensitive things, like work. 
    
* __An RPG game__
    Back in the day, there were tons of text only adventure games, and even now you could argue that interactive fiction is gaining a very slight community. There is no reason these things shouldn't be ported to slack so you could play them while you wait for your build.
