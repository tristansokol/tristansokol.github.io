Just like their full sized cousins, tiny houses have various electrical components to keep their inhabitants comfortable, but unlike actual houses there is way less social pressure to standardize everything to keep the resale value high. Instead of some kind of energy efficient sconce, or overhead florescent lights I opted for high power LED strips that are * super bright *very small *long lasting * PWMable. The last feature is one that I am particularly interested in. Dawn simulation, motion control, temperature logging.
